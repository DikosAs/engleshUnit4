        <p>1975 The very first school in the village of Zavyalovo was founded in 1853.

          52 years later, in the 1905-1906 school year, a parochial school was opened.

          In 1917, the school was transformed into an elementary school, in 1930 into a junior school, and in 1939 into a low-grade school.

          In 1991, in connection with the opening of agricultural classes in the parallels of grades 8-11 and on the basis of an agreement on Great Britain with the Izhevsk Agricultural Academy, the school was renamed “Zavyalovskaya Secondary School-College”.

          Since November 17, 2000, the school has been assigned the status of “Zavyalovskaya secondary school with in-depth study of individual subjects.”

          In 2011, the organizational and legal form of education was changed - a municipal budgetary educational institution.

          Principals of different years played a major role in the formation of the secondary school: Mikhail Vasilievich Baronov, Nina Fillipovna Bondaryuk, Nadezhda Ivanovna Makhneva, Galina Aleksandrovna Ershova, Yuri Nikolaevich Kuznetsov, Tatyana Vitalievna Koscheeva, Elvira Safiullovna Dudyreva.

          Since 2019, the school has been headed by Nadezhda Anatolyevna Mokrushina.

          Currently, the school teaches 2095 textbooks in 79 classes - sets. Teaching staff of 117 teachers. 17 teachers have the highest qualification category, 61 have the first.</p>
